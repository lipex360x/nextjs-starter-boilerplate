This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone this project with:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/lipex360x/nextjs-starter-boilerplate
# or
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/lipex360x/nextjs-starter-boilerplate
```

Then, start project with:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
